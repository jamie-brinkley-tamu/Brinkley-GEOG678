To hand in:

  Step 1: in Github

        1. Create a lab\08\ folder in your Github repository and link it to your main README.md

        2. Open the dashboard you created in a browser and take a screenshot of it. Upload your screenshot and your dashboard link to your lab\08\ folder (one screenshot, one link) 

        3. Open the Web-based Charts you created in a new browser and take screenshots (one for D3 and one for Highcharts). Upload your screenshots and HTML files to your lab\08\ folder (two screenshots, two HTML files) 

        4. Therefore, your lab\08 folder should contain the following 6 items (30pts/each, 180 pts in total): 
              a. One Link to the Operation Dashboard
              b. Two HTML Files include D3.html and HighCharts.html
              c. Three webpage screenshots of Dashboard, D3.html, and HighCharts.html

  Step 2: in Canvas:

        1. Submit the link of your Github lab\08\ folder to this page on Canvas.
